## Notes.

> Diagnostic tools are able to contact all ECUs installed in a vehicle, which has UDS services enabled. In contrast to the CAN bus protocol, which only uses the first and second layers of the OSI model, UDS utilizes the fifth and seventh layers of the OSI model. The Service ID (SID) and the parameters associated with the services are contained in the 8 data bytes of a message frame.
