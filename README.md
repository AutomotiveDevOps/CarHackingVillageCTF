>> CANedge2: 2x CAN Bus Data Logger (SD + WiFi)

> The plug & play 2xCAN/LIN logger records timestamped CAN data (Classical/CAN FD) to the extractable 8 GB industrial SD card.

> The small device connects via WiFi access points (e.g. WLAN or 3G/4G routers) to securely push data to your server. Further, the device can be updated over-the-air.

> The CANedge2 is ideal for telematics & fleet management - as well as R&D field tests, diagnostics and predictive maintenance.

> Software/APIs are free & open source - with no subscription fees or vendor lock-in.

## Notes.

> Diagnostic tools are able to contact all ECUs installed in a vehicle, which has UDS services enabled. In contrast to the CAN bus protocol, which only uses the first and second layers of the OSI model, UDS utilizes the fifth and seventh layers of the OSI model. The Service ID (SID) and the parameters associated with the services are contained in the 8 data bytes of a message frame.
